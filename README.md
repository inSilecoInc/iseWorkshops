[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/inSilecoInc/R_package_skeleton/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inSilecoInc/R_package_skeleton/actions?query=workflow%3AR-CMD-check)

This is our R package template repository. Note that this template was designed
to be used with the [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package (and
[`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)). Therefore, the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org) represents a valuable reference to work with this package skeleton.
